## Description

This tool is a data-driven CMS that allows you to model your own objects and assign them custom properties.
For example, you can create an Actor object with the properties name (string) and age (number), then link this object to others (such as a Movie).
The goal is to provide a flexible solution for structuring, managing, and querying your data without having to redevelop a custom backend.
